# RUNBOOK — guardian-universe

## Bootstrap the historical baseline (local, one-time)
NSE blocks datacenter IPs, so run backfill from a residential machine:
```
cd pipeline && uv run python -m pipeline backfill --days 300
```
Resumable — re-run to continue after an interruption (already-ingested days skip).

## Publish to the CDN (rolling GitHub Release)
Requires `gh` authenticated with write access to `SatioO/guardian-universe`:
```
cd pipeline && uv run python -m pipeline publish
```
Uploads `data/ohlc/ohlc_*.parquet` + `data/meta/manifest.json` to the `data-latest`
release. Clients read `manifest.json`, verify each file's `sha256`, then download.

## Manual daily run (single day)
Ingest one trading day (defaults to today) — the same pipeline as backfill, one date:
```
cd pipeline && uv run python -m pipeline daily [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
```
Non-trading days skip cleanly; an already-ingested day is an idempotent no-op.

## Alerts
- Row-count deviation / format break → run exits non-zero (fail-closed).
- Corrupt day (all rows quarantined) → `status: failed`, nothing written, retryable.

## Sync / publish semantics (G0)

- `python -m pipeline sync` is FAIL-CLOSED: any failure other than "release
  does not exist" exits 1 and stops the run. Never bypass it — publishing from
  an unsynced store is blocked by the guards below anyway.
- Data assets are content-addressed (`ohlc_2026.<sha8>.parquet`) and immutable;
  `manifest.json` is the only mutable asset and is flipped last. Unreferenced
  assets are garbage-collected 7 days after upload.
- `publish` refuses to: shrink coverage (fewer rows/years, older
  latest_trading_date), publish over a release that changed since sync
  (re-run the pipeline), or leave an unverified manifest (it re-downloads and
  checks itself after the flip).
- Recovery from a failed publish: nothing to clean up — the old manifest is
  still live and consistent; just re-run sync → daily → publish.

## Yearly
- Refresh `pipeline/data/meta/holidays.json` from NSE's published trading-holiday
  calendar (https://www.nseindia.com/resources/exchange-communication-holidays).
  Format: `{"YYYY": ["YYYY-MM-DD", ...]}` — one array of ISO dates per year.
